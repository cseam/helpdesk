# Helpdesk.

Internal Helpdesk system to allow users to log (tickets) or issues that they have around campus.

Writen to replace old asp helpdesk from 2004, the original helpdesk had basic functionality with a simple form to log tickets and a group view of tickets for engineers, the new system needs to expand on this providing managers some reporting functions, and to include a modern responsive design with the ability to work on mobile devices and include recent branding changes.

PHP/MySQL stack at pressent, but intention to move to NodeJS/Mongod in future builds.

System must be fully maintained by individual departments, without intervention from IT for day to day operations.
